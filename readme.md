# Dub-Suite üé¨üéôÔ∏è

**A comprehensive multilingual dubbing and audio processing toolkit**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** - This project is currently under active development and may contain incomplete features or unstable functionality.

## Overview

Dub-Suite is an advanced Python-based toolkit designed for automated video dubbing and audio processing. It provides a complete pipeline for extracting audio from videos, performing speech-to-text transcription, translating content, and generating multilingual voice dubbing with speaker diarization and voice cloning capabilities.

## Features

### üéØ Current Features

-   **Video Audio Extraction**: Extract high-quality audio from video files using FFmpeg
-   **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Powered by Whisper for accurate transcription
-   **Language Detection**: Automatic detection of source audio language
-   **Audio Source Separation**: Separate vocals from background music/SFX using Demucs
-   **Speaker Diarization**: Identify and separate different speakers in audio
-   **Translation**: Translate transcriptions between languages using Argos Translate
-   **Voice Cloning**: Extract reference audio samples for voice synthesis
-   **Audio Processing Utilities**: Format conversion and optimization tools

### üöß In Development

-   **Text-to-Speech Generation**: Multilingual TTS with voice cloning
-   **Audio Mixing and Merging**: Combine generated dubbing with original SFX
-   **Batch Processing**: Process multiple videos simultaneously
-   **Web Interface**: User-friendly GUI for non-technical users
-   **Quality Enhancement**: Advanced audio processing and noise reduction
